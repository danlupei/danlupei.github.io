# Preliminaries
- Floydhub setup according to [this](https://github.com/YuelongGuo/floydhub.fast.ai) writeup.
- If you don't know anything about artificial neural networks, I recommend Andrej Karpathy's [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/).

We are going to tackle the [Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) using VGG16 model, finetuned to our purposes.
Because our work is done in Jupyter notebooks, which lend themselves very well to presenting code an its output,
most of what you can see can be read from those notebooks present in my GitHub repo.
