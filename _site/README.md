This is source code of my blog at [danlupei.github.io ](http://danlupei.github.io) hosted using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) framework [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme.

I actually forked this from [erajasekar.com](http://erajasekar.com) as he had all the foundations laid out. Then I added my own content.

If you would like to build your own site, by using his blog as foundation, refer to this [post](http://erajasekar.com/posts/set-up-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
